## Estimating the impact of evidence volumes in Legal Aid spend

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<div class = "leftC1">
<h4>The situation:</h4>
</div>

<br>

<div class = "leftC2">
Prices in Crown Court Legal Aid work had been undergoing a sustained increase. Several drivers were identified that suggested that these increases would continue, such as: 
<ul><li>Increased electronic evidence</li>
<li>Media focus on collapse of trials due to lack of evidence</li>
<li>New guidance on the disclosure of data</li></ul>
However, there was no information to determine for how long these increases could continue.  In addition, prices had risen particularly quickly in more recent months and may be an indication of an accelerating trend.
</div>

<div class = "leftD1">
<h4>The analytical approach:</h4>
</div>

<div class = "rightB1">
<h4>Asking the right question:</h4>
</div>

<div class = "leftD2">
The existing model takes predicted court activity and calculates expected bill volumes, which a price forecast is then applied to.
</div>

<div class = "rightB2">
<ul><li>What should the price forecast be set at for Crown Court Legal Aid?</li> 
<li>What is the risk of over or underspending against this forecast?</li></ul>

<h4>Understanding and measuring uncertainty:</h4>
</div>

<div class = "leftC2">
<ul><li> Uncertainty around case volumes was discounted (<b>Dominant Uncertainty</b>) as the impact was expected to be small.</li>
<li>No information was available to determine the scale of future increases, so scenario analysis was used to assess the impact of certain assumptions.</li>
<li>The impacts of 3 price scenarios, representing price increases continuing for 3, 6 or 12 months,  were estimated.</li>
<li>Two additional scenarios were considered:</li>
<li>An increasing level of prices. Due to insufficient evidence to support it being considered for the main estimate, it was logged in the risk register to highlight the potential variance.</li>
<li>Prices levelling out immediately in case the full impact had already fed through. Due to the volume and timing of identified drivers this was felt to be very unlikely, so including it could be misleading and contribute to an optimism bias to the decision making. </li></ul>

<ul><li> Scenarios were presented taking the 3, 6 or 12 month assumptions for the central projection, with the higher and flat scenarios being logged in the risk register. The communication stressed that there was no information that would allow us to tell which scenario was more likely.</li>
<li>Decision makers agreed that the range of scenarios considered reflected the range of reasonable outcomes.</li>
<li>As no information was available on the which scenario was mostly likely, discussion focused on the risks that were associated with taking each scenario through for planning purposes, such as over or underspending against the overall budget.</li>
<li>Scenario analysis was used to provide a range of values to illustrate the large amounts of uncertainty around the forecast without  giving the impression that any particular outcome was more likely, allowing a decision to be made with the understanding of the risks involved.</li></ul>

## Estimating uncertainty in prison population projections

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<hr>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<div class = "leftC1">
<h4>The situation:</h4> 
</div>

<br>

<div class = "leftC2">
Prison population projections are the end result of a number of criminal justice system interconnected models. The uncertainty around each of these models had not been estimated, but understanding the uncertainty of prison projections was essential for capacity planning.
</div>

<div class = "leftD1">
<h4>The analytical approach:</h4>
</div>

<div class = "rightB1">
<h4>Asking the right question:</h4>
</div>

<div class = "leftD2">
Court demand and sentencing and forecasts were used within a prison population microsimulation model, with policy forecasts overlaid.
</div>

<div class = "rightB2">
<ul><li>How confident are we that the prison population will not exceed a particular threshold?</li> 
<li>Was there sufficient resource to estimate uncertainty using a traditional bottom-up approach (i.e. combining the uncertainty from all constituent models)?</li></ul>
</div>

<div class = "leftC1">
<h4>Defining and identifying uncertainty:</h4>
</div>

<div class = "leftC2">
<ul><li>Court demand projections</li>
<li>Sentencing assumptions (custody rate)</li>
<li>Impact estimates of future policy changes</li>
<li>Unknown impacts such as exogenous system shocks or policy changes not known at time of projection</li>
<li>Estimation error (such as sampling bias) from simulation model</li></ul>
</div>

<div class = "leftC1">
<h4>Understanding and measuring uncertainty:</h4>
</div>

<div class = "leftC2">
<ul><li> A top-down approach was chosen as the resource requirement for a traditional bottom-up approach would have been prohibitive. </li>
<li>The variance of all the previous forecast errors after 1 time period were fitted to a chosen probability distribution (in this case a normal distribution was chosen). This distribution was used to estimate the uncertainty of the new forecast after 1 time period.</li>
<li>This process was repeated for the variance at each subsequent time period.</li>
<li>The rate of change of variance was used to extrapolate the variance for periods where no forecast error existed.</li></ul>

Presenting and communicating uncertainty analysis
</div>

<div class = "leftC2">
<ul><li> We presented our historical forecast errors, explaining their main drivers and how each contributes to our current uncertainty range. This helped our key customers to better understand the uncertainties inherent in the system we model, and therefore why we can’t produce more precise forecasts.</li>
<li>The other aspect was helping customers think about how they should use the uncertainty estimates. For example: for the prison estate, assessing the likelihood of prison population reaching different levels together with an assessment of risk appetite and contingency measures we could use. This allowed for an evidence based approach for how much capacity we should plan for, not simply planning to the central estimate.</li></ul>

<li> Most numerical assumptions in the model (including dates) can be entered as a distribution (exact, uniform, or triangular, along with some bespoke distributions for specific purposes). </li>
