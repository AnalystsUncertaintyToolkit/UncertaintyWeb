<h1>Presenting and communicating uncertainty</h1>
<p><br><br></p>
<div class="rightA">
<p>We now consider how to choose <i>what</i> messages about uncertainty we should communicate to decision makers and give advice on <i>how</i> to communicate those messages effectively. A wealth of additional information can be found on the <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Communicating_Quality_Uncertainty_and_Change_for_publication.pdf">Government Statistical Service website</a></p>

<h2>Deciding what to communicate</h2>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<hr>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="rightA">
<p>The analysis of uncertainty is often complex. We need to choose carefully the key messages about uncertainty to communicate to decision makers – ensuring they receive enough information to understand the key points, without receiving so much that it clouds the central issue. <br><br> You should also consider the onward communication of your message to ensure that when your work is passed on to others its core message and integrity are maintained. Consider what decision makers <i>must</i>, <i>should</i>, or <i>could</i> know.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="images/Odd_tulip.png" width="394" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Decision makers are usually more comfortable with certain messages. This can make communicating uncertainty a difficult task. Decision makers can react adversely when faced with uncertainty, leading them to lose confidence in analysis. When uncertainty is large, decision makers may feel that the analysis is of no use.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Don’t let uncertainty undermine confidence in the analysis</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>A handy phrase to remember is “all models are wrong, but some are useful”. All analysis will be uncertain because every model is a simplification of reality. However, that does not stop them from being useful. Models allow us to better understand a system and uncertain results can help identify important features of that system.</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>If uncertainty means that a straightforward conclusion is not possible, focus your communication on what the uncertainty analysis <i>can</i> tell you. This may be the key factor that drives overall uncertainty or a greater understanding of how features of a system interact.</p>

<div id="presenting-caveats" class="section level2">
<h2>Presenting caveats</h2>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<hr>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="leftB">
<p>If most uncertainty is quantified, then present this prominently</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>If most of the overall uncertainty has been quantified, and you are confident that there are no unknowns which are likely to have a major impact on the results then this should be the most prominent message. Discussion of the unquantified uncertainties and risks can be included but should be positioned so that it doesn’t reduce confidence in the main results when this is not appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>If there are substantial unquantified uncertainties, then presenting the uncertainty that has been quantified without this important context will give a misleading impression of precision and underestimate the uncertainty. Do not present a range with incomplete coverage as final analysis if you know that there are substantial uncertainties that are not accounted for in that range.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>If little is quantified, then it may be better to present no quantification at all</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>If the largest source of uncertainty is the potential for a risk outside of the analysis to be realised, then this should be the most prominently displayed message.</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Think about how caveats are presented. A long list is unhelpful, but two or three upfront that have the most impact on the results are likely to be more helpful and easily understood. Consider which caveats have the greater impact on the final decision that is being made. You should explain what the caveats mean for decision makers who want to use the analysis, rather than simply setting out what they are.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Front load the important caveats and explain why they matter.</p>

<h2>Understanding the audience</h2>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<hr>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Understand your audience when choosing appropriate communication methods</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Before communicating your analysis you must consider who your audience is, why they should be interested in your work, what they know already, and what key message you need to convey to them to make their decision. People respond differently to different communication methods. It is good practice to always use Plain English, avoid analytical jargon with non analysts, and frame your results in terms of the decision being made and how it is useful for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>If it is a group or individual you have worked with before tailor the method to what has worked well in the past (or ask them or see how they respond to different formats).</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>A good relationship with your decision maker will help you to choose the right communication approach for them. It will also help you to understand their motivations and the implications of uncertainty for their decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Build relationships with decision makers</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>No matter how carefully you communicate the uncertainty to your immediate client, there is a risk that uncertainty will not be communicated upwards and that only the central numbers will persist, and important caveats will be excluded. This can also occur when writing part of a larger document – you need to ensure the key messages about uncertainty survive the drafting process.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Be conscious of how your analysis may be used in future communication</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>A good relationship with colleagues will minimise this risk. Work collaboratively to ensure that colleagues understand why central numbers could be misleading and in which situations it would be inappropriate for them to be communicated on their own. Always ensure that wherever possible you have sight of further communication before it is sent.</p>

<h2>Deciding how to communicate uncertainty</h2>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<hr>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Now you have determined who your audience is and what the message is you need to consider how to communicate with your decision makers. Firstly, think about how you will be communicating your results. Will this be via a written report, presentation, or an oral briefing with or without visuals? Any constraints on format may steer you to an approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>This section considers a range of approaches based on your understanding of the audience and the type of message you need to deliver.</p>

<h2>Communication basics</h2>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<hr>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><br></p>
<div clas="leftB">
<p>Identify who your audience is</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>As mentioned earlier, knowing who your audience is, what their interest is in this analysis, and how they interpret evidence will determine how you communicate. Test your communication with the audience, do they understand the key message from your prose or visualisations?</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>How something is written has a major impact on how people perceive the uncertainty. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17457289.2018.1465061">Research shows</a> that analysis is seen as less reliable if the outputs are conveyed only in words. Numbers should be presented within a sentence if possible as this helps give context, making them easier to read and understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Assess whether to describe uncertainty in words or attach figures</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Descriptive terms such as ‘low risk’ or ‘very likely’ can be interpreted very differently by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02684527.2014.994955">different people</a>. If possible, it is best to attach a numerical probability and use these words in support.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Be careful when using descriptive terms and adhere to an established system if possible</p>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<div class="rightA">
An exception to this is where there is an established system that your audience is used to for attaching terminology to probabilities, one that can be assumed to be well-understood by the intended audience. For example:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://wg1.ipcc.ch/SR/documents/ar5_uncertainty-guidance-note.pdf">According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)</a>, “very likely” means 90-100% probability.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bnf.nice.org.uk/guidance/adverse-reactions-to-drugs.html">According to NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence)</a>, probabilities of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 10 are referred to as “common”.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Presenting the likelihood of success <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/suz/dam/jcr:00000000-64a0-5b1c-0000-00003b7ec704/10.05-kahneman-tversky-79.pdf">may be perceived differently</a> to presenting the corresponding likelihood of failure. Present the information both ways to avoid bias (e.g. “there is an 80% chance of success and a 20% chance of failure”). By adding in the chance of failure, you remind the reader that it exists and how large it is, which may otherwise be overlooked. Visual part-to-whole comparisons can help with this. See <a href="https://rosiea1.github.io/UncertaintyWeb/chapter_4.html#infographics">infographics section</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Use positive and negative framing</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Research shows that there is no clear preference for choosing between probabilities and fractions (e.g. 10% probability, or 1 out of 10). Given this, <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-010814-020148">the usual preferences of the audience or the ‘norm’ within the organisation should be followed</a>. Note, that some people are more familiar with percentages than fractions or ratios.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Decide how to present your numbers</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>If using fractions, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625237">keep the denominator constant</a> (e.g. “1 in 100 vs. 2 in 100”, rather than “1 in 100 vs. 1 in 50”) and as small as possible while keeping to integers (e.g. “1 in 100” rather than “10 in 1,000”), rounding if appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Saying a ‘10% chance of rain’ is meaningless unless you also state the time period – e.g. in the next hour, or at some point tomorrow – and location.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Be clear on the specifics and applicability</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>If the outputs are only intended for use within a specific frame (for example, a specific area or to a particular group of the population), then make sure this is clearly stated alongside the outputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Consider the overall uncertainty in the numbers you have calculated. Round them appropriately to avoid spurious accuracy (e.g. perhaps 40% rather than 38.7% if the overall uncertainty is greater than one percentage point).</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Use an appropriate level of precision</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Presenting a single figure is best avoided as it can give a misleading impression of precision (e.g. “between 1,200 and 1,800”, rather than “1,500”).</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Use ranges wherever possible</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Commissioners may request a ‘best estimate’ for ease of onward use, but you must consider the risks in providing this. Try to understand how they intend to use the analysis, so you can provide something that meets their needs while also acknowledging the uncertainty.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Consider whether to include a ‘best estimate’ within the range</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Stating a range may be perceived as a uniform distribution across the range. Conversely, stating a range around a best estimate may be perceived as a triangular distribution (or Normal with analytical audiences). The output distribution could of course also be asymmetric or bi-modal. Consider which of these best reflects the actual uncertainty when deciding what to present.</p>
</div>

<p>Graphs can be an excellent way of communicating the quantified elements of uncertainty</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Graphs and visualisations are an excellent way of communicating the outputs of analysis, and many graph types allow you to communicate uncertainty within the graphic (provided the uncertainty has been quantified).</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Unquantified uncertainties cannot generally be included in graphs, so will need to be communicated through other means (e.g. a risk log and/or assumptions log).</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Some types of graphs are not particularly well suited to displaying quantified uncertainty, though this does not preclude their use if they are the most useful way to communicate a core message. You would need to find other ways to communicate uncertainty if using these chart types.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Some graph types cannot be used to show uncertainty clearly</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Some simple graphs e.g. <br> <i>Pie charts, donut charts, stacked charts</i></p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>May not always be useful when presenting uncertain analysis as they only show a single value for each data point. People can also find it difficult to compare angles or sizes of different sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>Avoid more complex graphs e.g. <br> <i>Heat and Choropleth maps, Treemaps, Sankey diagrams</i></p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>as it can be difficult to communicate uncertainty in very information dense visualisations. There is not space to include the necessary extra information among the colours of heatmaps, the densely packed rectangles of Treemaps or the detailed flow lines of Sankey diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>You may have the full understanding of the underlying probability distribution, or just a range within which we expect the result to fall. You may choose to only include the uncertainty due to a single dominant uncertainty, or the outputs from a range of scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="leftB">
<p>Decide what level of detail to include on uncertainty</p>
</div>
<div class="rightA">
<p>For representing numerical uncertainty, scatter plots with 2-dimensional error bars, line graphs with a range, bar or line graphs with error bars and single point graphs with error bars can be useful when representing an uncertain range. Box plots or box plot series can be useful when representing summary statistics. Probability (or Cumulative) Distribution functions are helpful if you have full knowledge of the distribution around a result.</p>
</div>

<p>For representing uncertainty due to alternative scenarios, multiple line graphs and descriptions in prose may be most helpful.</p>
